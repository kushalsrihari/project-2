# Getting Started with 2048

This game (2048) was built using **React**, **TypeScript** and **NodeJS**. The unique part of this example is animations. The animations in React aren't that straightforward, so I hope you can learn something new from it.



## How To Play?

You can play 2048 on [Github pages](https://mateuszsokola.github.io/2048-in-react/)
