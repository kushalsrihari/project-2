# Getting Started with 2048

This game (2048) was built using **React**, **TypeScript** and **NodeJS**. The unique part of this example is animations. The animations in React aren't that straightforward, so I hope you can learn something new from it.



## How To Play?

You can play 2048 on [Github pages](https://mateuszsokola.github.io/2048-in-react/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\


The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

DockerFile is present to create a Docker Image 
and Helm Chart is present to deploy in Kubernetes cluster 
increase replica as per the demand
